1) String refers to collection of characters. String is an object in java present in package called java.lang.String

2)There are types of strings in java :
 I)Muatable String =>Changable in nature
   Ex:String
 II)Immutable String => non-Changable in nature
   Ex:StringBuffer, StringBuilder
3)In 3 ways we can create string objects in java.
  I)Assigning a string value wrapped in "" to String type variable.
   String variable_name = "Data";
 II)Creating a object of the String class using the new keyword by passing the string value as parameter of its constructer.
   String vaeiable_name = new String("Data");
III)Passing Character array to String constructor.
   char var_name = {'G','o','d'};
   String variable_name = new String(var_name);

4)The SCP which is abbreviated as String Constant Pool is a special memory area which in heap area. When we decalre string literal, JVM creates an object in the pool and stores its reference on stack.

5)Muatable String =>changable in nature.
The mutable strings can be changes to any value or state without adding a new object.
   Ex:String
 II)Immutable String =>non-Changable in nature
Immutable string cannot be changed to its value or state once it is created.   
Ex:StringBuffer, StringBuilder

6)In Heap memory SCP is located.
