1)Default value of array for
   *Integer => 0
   *Byte    => 0
   *doluble => 0.0
   *Boolean =>false
   *String  =>null
   *Float   =>0.0
   *char    =>'\u0000'
2)No. We cannot pass negative number in Array size. It will give NegativeArraySizeException.
As per convention of array declaration it is mandatory that each time an array is evaluated it shall have a size greater than 0. declaring array size negative breaks this shall condition.

3)In JVM Memory Arrays are stored in heap area.
In Java reference types are stored in heap area. As Array is a reference type it is stored in heap area.

4)Disadvantages of Arrays are:
  I)Once we create the size, it cannot be   increased or decreased.
II) It stores only homogenous data elements.

5)  An Array without a name is an Anonymous array in java.
Ex:
class cls {
    public int add(int arr[])
    {
        int result = 0;
        for( int n: arr){
            result = result + n;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
public class Array_4_Anonymous_Array {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        cls obj = new cls();
        //Anonymous Array
        int result = obj.add(new int[]{1,9,5});
        System.out.println(result);


    }

}
6)The different ways of traversing arrays are:
  *Using Enhanced for loop
  *Using for loop
  *while loop
  *do-while loop
7)length => it is property of array type class.
  length() => It is the method of string class.
